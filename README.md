MSP430G2553 is a 16 MHz MCU with 16KB FLASH, 512B SRAM, 10-bit ADC, Comparator, UART/SPI/I2C, Timer Microcontroller. Energia is an open-source electronics prototyping platform started by Robert Wessels in January of 2012 with the goal to bring the Wiring and Arduino framework to the Texas Instruments MSP430 based LaunchPad. The Energia IDE is cross platform and supported on Mac OS, Windows, and Linux. Energia uses the mspgcc compiler by Peter Bigot and is based on the Wiring and Arduino framework. Energia includes an integrated development environment (IDE) that has it’s foundation in the Processing IDE (Processing→Wiring→Arduino→Energia). Energia is also a portable framework/abstraction layer that can be used in other popular IDEs. Utilize a web browser based environment with Texas Instruments CCS Cloud at dev.ti.com or TI’s powerfull CCS Desktop IDE.
